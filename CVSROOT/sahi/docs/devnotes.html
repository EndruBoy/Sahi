<h4><a name="basics">How does Sahi work?</a></h4>

Sahi's core parts include the <b>Sahi proxy server</b> and the <b>javascript engine</b><br/>

<img src="sahi_architecture.gif"/><br/>
Html responses which pass through the proxy are modified such that javascript is injected at the start and end of the response.<br/>
This will allow the browser to record and playback scripts and talk back to the proxy when needed.<br/>
<br/>

Apart from handling requests for pages that the browser requests,
<br/>Sahi also handles custom commands related to recording, playback etc. which the browser sends.<br/>



<br/>
<br/>

<h4><a name="delayed">How does the script in sah files execute?</a></h4>

The Sahi script, even though looking like javascript, is not executed as regular javascript on the browser.<br/>
The reasons for this are:
<ul>
<li>The script refers to objects spread over multiple pages and will result in errors if executed directly on any page</li>
<li>The script needs to be executed step by step with a slight delay between execution of each step.<br/>
This cannot be accomplished directly since javascript has no way of pausing execution.</li>
</ul>

Sahi handles this by parsing and modifying the script in the proxy.<br/><br/>
Thus, a line which looked like this:<br/>
<b>_click(_link("Link Test"));</b><br/>
<br/>
gets translated to:<br/>
<b>sahiAdd("sahi_click(sahi_link(\"Link Test\"));", "sahi_demo.sah : 3")</b><br/>
<br/>

The method sahiAdd(cmd, debugInfo) takes two parameters.<br/>
The first is the line of script, which has been converted into a string.<br/>
The second is debug information which the proxy adds.<br/>
<pre>
function sahiAdd(cmd, debugInfo){
    var i = _sahiCmds.length;
  _sahiCmds[i] = cmd;
  _sahiCmdDebugInfo[i] = debugInfo;
}
</pre>

During page load, all the lines in the script are thus added to an array.<br/>
A counter is maintained on the server which marks the index in the array of the step that is to be run next.<br/>
This counter is updated with each successful execution of a step.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>

<h4><a name="variable">Why do variables need to be prefixed with a dollar($) sign?</a></h4>

When variables are used, the transformation of script is as follows:<br/>
<b>var $linkText = "Link Test";</b><br/>
<b>_click(_link($linkText));</b><br/>
<br/>
becomes<br/>
<b>var $linkText = "Link Test";</b><br/>
<b>sahiAdd("sahi_click(sahi_link("+s_v($linkText)+"));", "sahi_demo.sah : 4")</b><br/>

<pre>
function s_v(v){
    var type = typeof v;
    if (type == "number") return v;
    else if (type == "string") return "\""+v+"\"";
    else return v;
}
</pre>

Thus, what will eventually execute, will be:<br/>
<b>sahi_click(sahi_link("Link Test"));</b><br/>

<br/>
For easy identifcation of variables while parsing, it is needed that there is some way of tagging variables. <br/>
The dollar($) sign serves that purpose.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<hr/>
<br/>

<h4><a name="underscore">Why do all Sahi APIs start with an underscore?</a></h4>

Sahi scripts are loaded with each page that appears on the browser.<br/>
Since it is all javascript, the API function names need to be unique.<br/>
If the application under test has a function with the same name, it can cause problems.
<br/>
For this, all API functions start with "sahi_".<br/> When Sahi's proxy serves the script to the browser, it parses and does a lot of modifications to the script.<br/> One of these is to correctly replace the API methods starting with "_" with "sahi_".
<br/><br/>
Thus, <br/>
<b>_click(_link("Create Login"));</b><br/>
actually becomes <br/>

<b>sahi_click(sahi_link("Create Login"));</b><br/>
<br/>
Starting the APIs with "_" helps in easy substitution with "sahi_" with less scope for ambiguity.<br/>
