<!--Web Automation and Test Tool-->
<h4><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h4>

Sahi is an automation and testing tool for web applications, with the facility to record and playback scripts.<br/>
Developed in java and javascript, this tool uses simple javascript to execute events on the browser. <br/>
Features include, in-browser controls, text based scripts, ant support for playback of suites of tests,<br/>
and multi threaded playback. It supports HTTP and HTTPS.<br/>

<br/>

Sahi runs as a proxy server and the browser needs to use the sahi server as its proxy.<br/>
Sahi then injects javascript so that it can access elements in the webpage.<br/>
This makes the tool independent of the website/ web application.<br/>
