Reintroduced interval between tests when run in suite. Made the interval configurable.
Sahi code is now injected into blank html pages too.
Fixed bug which prevented using an external proxy.

Known issues
* Firefox has problems with multithreaded playback due to session sharing across windows. (Workaround: Do not add the 'threads=n' clause to sahi target)
