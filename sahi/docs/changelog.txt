* Features added
    Some basic support for identifying script errors in script using "View Script" link on the controller.

* Bugfixes
    HTTPS was not working because of a couple of problems:
    Keep-alive needed to be disabled for proxying ssl requests.
    including java.ext.dirs in sahi.bat/sh was causing ssl libraries to not be included.
    So: Excluded ssl from keep-alive and removed java.ext.dirs.
    Not sure if this fixes SSL support in Mac.
        
Known issues
* Firefox has problems with multithreaded playback due to session sharing across windows. 
(Workaround: Do not add the 'threads=n' clause to sahi target)
* Calls to non existent functions in script does not fail script
