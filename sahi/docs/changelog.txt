Known issues
* Firefox has problems with multithreaded playback due to not being able to kill browsers properly.
(Workaround: Do not add the 'threads=n' clause to sahi target)
* Turn off keep-alive in sahi.properties if browser hangs
* IE7 will always bypass proxy for http://localhost. Use http://machine_name/ instead
* Framesets with frames from different domains will not work with Sahi
