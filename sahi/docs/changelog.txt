* Fixed bug for some submitted pages not working properly on IE
* Added socket pool to prevent Connect exceptions when there are a lot of tests
* Fixed bug to prevent injection of html code into js files
* Added documentation for _callServer and a few other apis
* Displaying an error page when remote server is down. Tests do not stop anymore.

Known issues
* Firefox has problems with multithreaded playback due to session sharing across windows. 
(Workaround: Do not add the 'threads=n' clause to sahi target)
* Debug does not step correctly.
* Form elements with $ in them are not recorded correctly. You have to explicity replace $ with \$ in script.
